# Salon-Attachment-Color-Analysis
## Project Objective

This project analyzes hair attachment usage in a salon to identify the most used attachment colors within a specific period (December 2025).
The goal is to help salon owners make data-driven restocking decisions, reduce overstocking, and maximize profit by focusing on high-demand attachment colors.
The analysis was performed in Excel, and an interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to visualize trends, usage patterns, and profitability.
